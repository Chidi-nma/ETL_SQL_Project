# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
My goal for this project was to go through the Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading process for an e-commerce website. 
As well as analyse and clean the data in order to derive insights that'll allow the owner of this e-commerce business to make informed decisions. 

## Process
> Below is the process I took 
### Downloaded the data. 
### Set up the e-commerce database in pgAdmin
### Created the table headers in the database
### Extracted the data from the CSV files. 
### Created Primary and foreign keys 
### Explored the tables to understand the data
### Cleaned the data 
### Analysed the data to derive insights


## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges
