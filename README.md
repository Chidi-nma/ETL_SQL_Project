# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
My goal for this project was to go through the Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading process for an e-commerce website. 
As well as analyse and clean the data in order to derive insights that'll allow the owner of this e-commerce business to make informed decisions. 

## Process
> Below is the process I took 
1. Downloaded the data. 
2. Set up the e-commerce database in pgAdmin
3. Created the table headers in the database
4. Extracted the data from the CSV files. 
5. Created Primary and foreign keys 
6. Explored the tables to understand the data
7. Cleaned the data 
8. Analysed the data to derive insights
