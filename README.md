# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
My goal for this project was to go through the Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading process for an e-commerce website. 
As well as analyse and clean the data in order to derive insights that'll allow the owner of this e-commerce business to make informed decisions. 

## Process
> Below is the process taken with the dataset.
1. Downloaded the data. 
2. Set up the e-commerce database in pgAdmin
3. Created the table headers in the database
4. Extracted the data from the CSV files. 
5. Created Primary and foreign keys 
6. Explored the tables to understand the data
7. Cleaned the data 
8. Analyzed the data to derive insights


## Results
1. San Francisco, USA, generates the most revenue for these e-commerce websites, sitting at 19%. 
2. Site visitors from Saudi Arabia and Czechia order the most products on average. 
3. Over 90% of all products ordered are in the Home category of products. 
4. The top-selling products outperforming other products in terms of the number of orders are the Google 17oz Stainless Steel Bottle. 
5. During Black Friday months(Nov & Dec) in 2016, the product with the highest number of page views is the Google Men's 100% Cotton Short Sleeve Hero Tee Navy.


## Challenges 
1. Determining the data types to store some of the columns because there wasn't enough information on what the column was. 
2. Limited time to work on the dataset. 

## Future Goals
1. Spend more time cleaning the data and doing research to understand the dataset.
2. Explore more insights from the data.
